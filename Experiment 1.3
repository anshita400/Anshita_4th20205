//aim:Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize name as //"Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.  Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee //information.
class Employee {
    String name;
    double salary;

    public Employee() {
        name = "Unknown";
        salary = 0;
    }

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        salary = 5000;
    }

    public void DisplayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: $" + salary);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp1 = new Employee();
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("John Doe");

        System.out.println("Employee 1 Details:");
        emp1.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Employee 2 Details:");
        emp2.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
    }
}
//Employee 1 Details:
//Employee Name: Unknown
//Employee Salary: $0.0

//Employee 2 Details:
//Employee Name: John Doe
//Employee Salary: $5000.0
